<p>Fluditeg is based on the Peltier effect and is capable of transforming into electrical energy the heat energy produced in normal operational circumstances by endothermic engines which would be otherwise burnt off into the atmosphere.</p>

<p>The device, supplied with fluids at different temperature ranging from 60 to 200 °C, produces electric energy in relation with both, the amount of heat energy applied and the temperature delta between the fluids. The main advantage of such a device is the opportunity to recover part of the heat energy produced and otherwise wasted.</p>

<p>It is primarily made up of aluminum plates, wafer-assembled, accommodating two separate hydraulic circuits. The thermoelectric effect is the direct conversion of temperature differences into electric voltage. The efficiency is 3.5% circa so that for 8600Kcal (10KWh) applied in heat energy, 350Wh in electrical energy are produced. Such a device would be sized 12dm3, outputting circa 300W/350W using two fluids at 75°C temperature delta and it would weight circa 35Kg. As a matter of comparison, a typical liner bus burns off into the atmosphere 50% of the heat produced so for 100KWh applied on the wheels, we easily get to as much energy wasted.</p>

<p>Also provides a number of additional advantages:
<ol>
<li>fuel consumption reductions up to 3%</li>
<li>emission reductions</li>
<li>no additional costs (given that the existing generator can be replaced)</li>
</ol></p>
